**What I Did Today:**

Today I:
- created an API Gateway
- added in CORS, so that any URL can access our API
- created a “GET” request, to get the user info
- added in a “mapping” template, to specify what parameters it allows to be passed in
- enabled CORS, or we cannot access the API due to being in different domains
- published the API, so it is visible on the Internet
