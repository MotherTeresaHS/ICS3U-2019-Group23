**What I Did Today:**

Today I:
- created an AWS Cognito user pool
- created an app client
- used the Cognito built-in signup URL to create a user and click on the provided link to confirm the user
- confirmed the user now exists in the Congnito pool
- ensured this user also exists in the DynamoDB table, so that this user has information in your table
